# Hand Writting Recognition

Neural network to recognise hand writting number (0-9)
The Neural network is composed of:
    - Input layer of 28x28 neurons (size of each image) which is flattened
    - Hidden layers of 512 neurons
    - Output layers of 10 neurons for the classification (each one corresponds to a number)
    
    
Data is from mnist
Implemented with Keras 

The Callback function provides to stop network when 99% of accuracy is met.
